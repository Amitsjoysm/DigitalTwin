# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Initial analysis complete. Found that Newport AI integration was mocked.
      Services are running (backend, frontend, MongoDB, Redis).
      User has valid API keys configured.
      Plan: 
      1. Implement real Newport AI DreamAvatar 3.0 Fast integration
      2. Add video display in chat interface
      3. Test basic text-to-video conversation flow
      4. Then add voice recording and other input modes

    message: |
      Implementation Phase 1 Complete!
      
      ✅ Backend Services Implemented:
      - TTS Service: Converts text responses to audio using Newport AI TTS Pro API
      - Video Service: Generates talking videos using DreamAvatar 3.0 Fast API
      - Storage Service: Uploads files to Newport AI storage and returns public URLs
      - Chat Route: Full flow - text → TTS → audio → video generation → return task_id
      - Avatar Upload: Extracts frame from video, uploads to Newport AI storage
      
      ✅ Frontend Implemented:
      - Video player in ChatInterface
      - Polling mechanism for video status (checks every 2s for 60s)
      - Loading indicators during video generation
      - Auto-play video when ready
      
      🔄 Integration Flow:
      1. User uploads avatar video/image → extracts frame → uploads to Newport AI
      2. User sends chat message → Groq generates text response
      3. Text → TTS API → audio URL
      4. Audio + Avatar Image → DreamAvatar 3.0 → video task_id
      5. Frontend polls video status → displays video when complete
      
      ⚠️ Ready for Testing:
      Need to test the full flow end-to-end with real Newport AI APIs.
      All services are integrated and backend is running healthy.
      Frontend should be able to display videos once generation completes.
